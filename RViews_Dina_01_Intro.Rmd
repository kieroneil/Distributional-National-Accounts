##Introduction  
This is the first in a series of posts to help R users with an interest in economics understand the work of Piketty, Zucman, and Saez on the distribution of national income, wealth, and taxes across the adult US population. These economists argue that income and wealth inequality is growing at an alarming rate and the wealthiest people are now paying the lowest effective tax rate of any income class. This series will take you step-by-step through the models and data transformations needed for full-spectrum analysis of their work. We will be using the data provided by Piketty, Zucman, and Saez which includes yearly files of every distinct US income and wealth cohort packed with over 140 variables, and we will be following outline of my forthcoming e-book **Economics in R: US Distributional National Accounts** (Spring 2020).

## What is Distributional National Accounts  
Distributional National Accounts is a way to see how income, wealth, and taxes are distributed across a population, in this case the US.  The ultimate goal is to do this with every developed country so that comparisons across nations is possible. In each file every adult person is represented as a member of a cohort and every dollar of national income is accounted for.  One way to think of it is if you arrange the income of each person in ascending order you can check the income of the middle person to get the median income in the country for that year.    

Thank goodness for the `weighted.median()` function in the `spatstat` package.

In this way you can compare how the bottom 50% of people are doing compared to the middle-class or the top 1%.  You can also compare these across years to see how income & wealth has distribution has changed over time.  


##Why you should care in six charts  
The data is given in yearly "micro-files" from 1962 to 2018 where each record in the file represents a cohort of US adults.  Their income, wealth and taxes are broken down to a granular level so an analyst can take a deep dive into any segment of the population.  The economists use 2014 as a base year even though 2018 is the latest year and includes the effects of the 2017 Tax Reform.  

Unless you are a billionaire these charts should concern you.  

###Chart 1 - The bottom 90% vs the top 1%  
You are going to start to see a recurring theme around the year 1980.  This is the year everything started to go off the rails for the average American.  

From 1946 to 1966 income growth for both groups are highly correlated. From 1966 to 1980 the income of the bottom 90% was growing faster than the top 1%.  After 1980 the bottom 90% income still grew at a steady pace from about $30,000 to $38,000 but the income of the top 1 went from about $600,000 to about $1.3 million per year.  In 1980 it took twenty bottom-90 incomes to equal a single top 1% income; in 2014 it was 34.21 to 1, indicating that the wealthiest are pulling away from the rest of society.

###Chart 2 - The top 0.1% share of national income  
The adult population in 2014 was 243 million so 0.1% of that is 243,000 people.  Those 243,000 people took 9.3% of all income while the bottom 50% (~120 million people) received 12.5% of national income. 
In 1980 the share of income going to the top 0.1% was less than 4% of total income so their share has more than doubled.

###Chart 3 - The rise of the Top 10%  
Again, if we look at 1980 the share of income earned by the top 10% of earners went from 35% to 50% in 2012.  It stayed steady at 35% for 40 years before taking off after 1980. 
Notice that the top 10% income share has surpassed the highest peak before the Great Depression circa ~1928.  
![](images/income_share_top_10.png)

###Chart 4 - The big switcheroo  
In 1980 the bottom 50% of income earners brought in around 20% of all income and the top 1% brought in about 8%.  By 2014 they have completely switched with the 1% bringing home 20% of national income and the bottom 50% bringing in around 11%.  The cross-over year was 1995.  

Even to the untrained eye this looks like a transfer of wealth from the bottom 120 million people to the top 243,000 people.

###Chart 5 - The stagnating incomes of the bottom 50%  
Since 1980 the real average income of someone in the bottom 50% of earners went up $200.  Yes, over 34 years they got a total increase of 1.23% or 0.036% per year.  Meanwhile at the country club the income of the top 1% more than tripled with an average yearly gain of 1.97%.  In 2012 Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz [calculated](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2012/05/joseph-stiglitz-the-price-on-inequality) that 91% of all GDP gains go to the top 1% and the bottom 99% get to split the remaining 9%.

###Chart 6 - What happened to all the tax revenue?  
The image below is from an infographic in this excellent [NY Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/06/opinion/income-tax-rate-wealthy.html) that uses the data that we will be working with.  Look at the effective tax rate of the top 400 go from over 70% in 1950 to the lowest tax rate of any group.  This revelation refutes the general assumption that the US has a progressive tax system.  The US **had** a progressive tax system, now it's basically a flat tax that gets regressive at the top.  
It's interesting that the 95th to 99th percentile changed the least over time and serves as a pivot-point.  I highly recommend checking out the NY Times article.  I'll have to figure out how to recreate it in `ggplot()`.

##What's coming up  
My goal is to get any R user interested in analyzing this data up and running as quickly as possible.    

This series of articles will resolve all of the roadblocks I encountered as I wrangled the data into usable shape.  

When I discovered the dataset the first issue I ran into was that they were Stata files. **How do I import Stata files?**  Luckily, the `haven` package has a function to read Stata files.  

Next hurdle, these are pretty big files. Even though they top out at about 68,000 records they have 146 columns each.  You don't necessarily want to load every year, every time so **how do I only bring in the years I want.**  

Then ... **OMG what are these variable names!!**  They all need to be replaced with more verbose names with a standard naming convention.  These are the source names for the wealth variables.  
```{r eval=FALSE}
hwequ + hwfix + hwhou + hwbus + hwpen + hwdeb
```


**Reconcile the data** with itself and with official US data.  Some of the variables are aggregates of other granular variables.  I disect each one and validate that it matches the source data (and it does) and then check it against official data.  We are mainly interested that Adult Population and National Pre-tax Income match.  

**Create proportions** so that I know how much income & wealth comes from each granular source.  
Here are all of the granular variables that make up total wealth.  
Notice the better names from the source names above.  
```{r eval=FALSE}
summ_wealth_net = 
        assets_equity +
        assets_currency +
        assets_housing +
        assets_business +
        assets_pension_lifeins +
        liabilities_household, 
recon_wealth_net = 
        ttl_wealth_net - summ_wealth_net,
```


**Create distributions.**  This whole brand of economics is about distributions and they did not supply a variable that indicates where each cohort is on the income & wealth distributions so I calculate it and add it to the main dataset. 

When we are finished you will have 263 columns and everything you need to start exploring.  

##End notes  
### The economists  
Distributional national accounts is not a new economic idea but it has gotten renewed interest due to the prolific effort of three French economists, two of which are now working in the US.  

**Thomas Piketty** of the Paris School of Economics released his landmark book [Capital in the 21st Century](https://www.amazon.com/Capital-Twenty-First-Century-Thomas-Piketty-ebook/dp/B074DVRW88/ref=pd_sim_351_1/134-2855640-8324869?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B074DVRW88&pd_rd_r=0379234b-5bf2-41dd-84a0-a96590f914cb&pd_rd_w=qjXh7&pd_rd_wg=y4Qj9&pf_rd_p=65e3eab0-d81f-4a76-93ff-f0b7b1d6cd3d&pf_rd_r=M7SJ2E2DQHXTFXFJC0HD&psc=1&refRID=M7SJ2E2DQHXTFXFJC0HD) in 2014 that showed in no uncertain terms that capital income is growing much faster than labor income and that the fruits of any economic gains were disproportionally going to the top 1% of income earners compared to the past. Those with high wealth could grow that wealth at much higher rates than inflation creating dynastic wealth.  Professor Piketty is releasing his follow-up [Capital and Ideology](https://www.amazon.com/Capital-Ideology-Thomas-Piketty-ebook/dp/B082DKPPP1/ref=pd_sim_351_2/134-2855640-8324869?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B082DKPPP1&pd_rd_r=713415f8-9455-4197-b284-44bf33a50c2e&pd_rd_w=mtgxe&pd_rd_wg=0i4kh&pf_rd_p=65e3eab0-d81f-4a76-93ff-f0b7b1d6cd3d&pf_rd_r=K9MKY7TXTGXB5P0M9NBT&psc=1&refRID=K9MKY7TXTGXB5P0M9NBT) in March 2020 and should be a bestseller even though it is over 1000 pages long; that's about 30 hours for those of us that prefer to listen.  Piketty has been at this for awhile.  His first book [The Economics of Inequality](https://www.amazon.com/Economics-Inequality-Thomas-Piketty-ebook/dp/B013HZ8U0G/ref=pd_sim_351_1/134-2855640-8324869?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B013HZ8U0G&pd_rd_r=44499a69-94a6-4721-b93f-b58904c992ce&pd_rd_w=z66Cv&pd_rd_wg=d1pzH&pf_rd_p=65e3eab0-d81f-4a76-93ff-f0b7b1d6cd3d&pf_rd_r=TJKFD9CY8KWSYTMDQ4X9&psc=1&refRID=TJKFD9CY8KWSYTMDQ4X9) was originally published in France in 1997 and was finally translated to English in 2015. 

**Emmanuel Saez** and **Gabriel Zucman** are both professors of economics at the University of California - Berkeley and have recently released [The Triumph of Injustice: How the Rich Dodge Taxes and How to Make Them Pay](https://www.amazon.com/Triumph-Injustice-Rich-Dodge-Taxes-dp-1324002727/dp/1324002727/ref=mt_hardcover?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=) which details the demise of the progressive tax system in the US and elegant solutions that prevent the highest earners from paying a lower tax rate than their help.  They are the primary developers of the US datasets that will be used in this series and have been helpful when I reached out to them with questions concerning the data.  Professor Zucman has also published [The Hidden Wealth of Nations - The Scourge of Tax Havens](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/022642264X/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i1) in 2013.  

I think you get the picture of what they are focused on. 

The main site for [US Distributional National Accounts](http://gabriel-zucman.eu/usdina/) is hosted by Gabriel Zucman and contains links to the data, the data appendix/dictionary, and their published paper on the subject.
